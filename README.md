# TOSU

### It is pronounced "toss" because you will be tosuing your keyboard out the window.

## ABOUT

**Tosu** (Typing Osu) is a rhythm game where you press all letters of the keyboard to the music!

Currently being remade from the ground up, not much game exists yet.

## EXPORTING ON LINUX

Download Raylib 5.0 and this repository, then in the terminal type `make` while in the tosu repo.
This will make an executable file called `tosu.out`.
