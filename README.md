# TOSU

It is pronounced "toss" because you will be tosuing your keyboard out the window.

**Tosu** (Typing Osu) is a rythm game where you use all letters of the keyboard!

Currently being remade from the ground up, not much game is made yet.

## EXPORTING ON LINUX

Download Raylib 5.0 and this repository, then in the terminal type `make` while in the tosu repo.
This will make an executable file called `tosu.out`.

## HOW TO PLAY

The core of the game doesn't yet exist :(

## DEVELOPED WITH

 - Raylib 5.0
 - C language
